Process:

1. Ask clarifying questions.
    - What kind of data is being input (format and semantics)
    - How big is the input?
    - Can the input be negative?
    - Can the input be null?
2. Design an algorithm.
3. Write pseudocode.
4. Write real code.
5. See if we can make it faster, smaller, or cleaner.
6. Check basic correctness and think of edge cases.
7. Test code.
8. Postmortem.

Strategies:

- Examplify
- Pattern matching
- Simplify and generalize
- Base case and build
- Data structure brainstorm

Ideas:

- If there is information in the problem (the array is sorted, the numbers don't exceed X, etc.), it's probably useful in some way.
- Generate possible solutions then remove nonsolutions.
