2.3-6
Observe that the while loop of lines 5 - 7 of the INSERTION-SORT procedure in Section 2.1 uses a linear search to scan (backward) through the sorted subarray A[1..j-1]. Can we use a binary search (see Exercise 2.3-5) instead to improve the overall worst-case running time of insertion sort to Ө(n lg(n))?

No. The outer loop is Θ(n), but even if we replace the while loop (Θ(n)) with a binary search (Θ(lg(n))), we will still have to move elements over, which is Θ(n).
