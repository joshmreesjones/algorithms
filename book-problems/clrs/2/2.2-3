2.2-3
Consider linear search again (see Exercise 2.1-3). How many elements of the input sequence need to be checked on the average, assuming that the element being searched for is equally likely to be any element in the array? How about in the worst case? What are the average-case and worst-case running times of linear search in Θ-notation? Justify your answers.

n / 2 elements need to be checked on average. Each element of the input sequence is equally likely to be the value. If each element is ai, and the sequence goes from a1, a2, a3 to an, then element ai would need i elements to be checked before it would be checked. The average of the number of checks needed to reach each element (which is important here because each is equally likely to be the value) is thus n / 2.

In the worst case, n elements need to be checked because the array is searched linearly from start to finish.

The average-case and worst-case running time of linear search is Θ(n) because in the average case the coefficient 1/2 becomes relatively insignificant for large values of n.
