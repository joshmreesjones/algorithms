How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar? How are they different?
Similar - they are both problems in finding how to traverse a graph.
Different - I think the shortest-path problem is not NP-complete, whereas the traveling-salesman problem is NP-complete. The shortest-path problem is easily solvable, whereas the traveling-salesman problem is not solvable.
